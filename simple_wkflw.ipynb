    "To provide an update on this project to our team, I am subsetting the data that plotted properly in `identifying_ctracts_oversampling.ipynb` and overlaying them to see their overlap relative to the CalEnviroScreen data. An output of 2 csv files containing census tracts that overlapped, and census tracts that did not overlap will be produced, alongside some engaging visualizations. The objective is to create a framework that will be later leveraged once the Climate Vulnerability Metric and EJScreen data are wrangled.\n"
